      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        Sam completed his undergraduate education at the University of Arizona,
        obtaining a Bachelors of Science (B.S.) degree in Chemical Engineering in the Spring of 2019.
      </p>

      <h2>Work</h2>

      <p>Sam is currently an Associate Research Engineer in Dow's Hydrocarbons R&D organization. In particular,
         Sam's group is researching propane dehydrogenation chemistry in the context of fluidized circulating bed processes.
          The specific technology that Sam supports is known as Fluid Catalytical Dehydrogenation (FCDh), a newer propane
           dehydrogenation technology which has the ability to be retrofitted into existing commercial hydrocarbon cracking units.
            In addition, this technology is competitive with other mainstream fluidized dehydrogenation processes (i.e UOP, Exxon)
             in terms of overall energy usage and dehydrogenation performance.
      </p>

      <p>In this role, Sam has been involved in many stages of the research cycle: experiment design, material procurement,
         scheduling, data analysis, documentation and write-up of study results. Additional responsibilities have included
          the utilization of Good Engineering Practices (GEP), Management of Change (MOC), and adherance to mechanical integrity
           standards in plant operations and improvement projects.
      </p>

      <h2>Background</h2>

      <p>Sam was originally born in Clovis, CA, but relocated to sourthern Arizona shortly after birth. He attended highschool
         in southern Arizona and eventually attended the University of Arizona with the intention of studying Engineering.
         He dropped out of University during his first semester due to personal circumstancesâ€“leaving during Fall of 2013 with a 0.0 GPA.
          Sam was able to overcome this failure and reinvent himself as a devoted student, re-entering the University of Arizona in 2015
          with a concentration in Chemical Engineering. During his undergraduate career, Sam tried to diversify his experiences as much
           as possible: involving himself in undergraduate research, leadership positions within student organizations like the Society
            of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE), outreach involvement as a member of the Engineering Ambassadors, and student
             internships with Johnson & Johnson, Kimberly-Clark, and Dow.
